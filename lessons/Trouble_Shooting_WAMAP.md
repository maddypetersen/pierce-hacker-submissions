## Introduction
This Tutorial is designed as a guide to help students troubleshoot commonly enountered issues when doing homework in WAMAP. While not all possible issues will be covered, we will discuss frequently asked questions regarding answer submission in WAMAP. The issues we will cover have been reported as commonly encountered problems by students, tutors, and math professors.

## Section 1: General Tips and Tricks
### a. The Dropdown Menu
On some questions, the author may enable a dropdown menu that can act as a template and/or a guide for how to submit your answers. If there is ever any doubt about syntax in your mind, heck this menu.

### b. Preview
Many questions will also feature a preview button next to the answer submission box. Whenever possible, it is a good idea to take a quick look at the preview before yu submit an answer. This will show you exactly how WAMAP is interpretting your submission, and it can catch some mistakes before they are made. For example, say your answer is a function in terms of "x," but you made a typo and accidentally typed "z" instead. The preview feature will catch this and alert you to the issue.

## Section 2: Some Common Issues encountered in a Variety of Classes
### a. Parentheses: When, Where, and How Many?
Parentheses are a big deal in WAMAP, and in mathematics in general. There are a lot of situations in which parenthese can make or break your answer. Sometimes when we write down an answer on paper, it may make sense to skip the seemingly repetative parentheses, but when it comes to electronic answer submission, they are vital. As a general rule of thumb, more parentheses is typically a good idea, but there are a lot of exceptions to this. Let's take a look at an answer that might make sense to us without parantheses, but that WAMAP sees as something completely different.

In this example, not icluding parentheses in the numerator results in WAMAP completely misinterpretting the answer. Now let's check out that same problem, this time with all of the necessary parentheses.

### b. Fractions vs. Decimals
Knowing when to use fractions and when to use decimals is an important skill in WAMAP. Some questions will explicity state whether they require an answer as one r the other, but many others will not. In general, it is often not a bad idea to use fractions, because they are in general more accurate. That being said, the most important thing when given numerical answers is to check whether or not the question specifies a format.

### c. Numbers vs. Algebraic Functions
WAMAP is designed as a dynamic program that can not only check and accept answers, but perform some calculations for you. This feature an sometimes be used to avoid possible errors. For example, let's say that you can calculate the answer to a question by subtracting 1/4 from 1/3. If the questions specifically asks for your answer as a fraction, decmial, or number, you will need to do this calculation on your own. However, if no specific format is given, it is frequantly possible to simply enter "1/3-1/4" as your answer, and WAMAP will be able to do the subtraction for you, thus eliminating possible rounding and/or arithmetic errors.

### d. Trig Functions of Degree>1
$$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}$$
### e. Inverse Trig Functions

### f. Rounding
