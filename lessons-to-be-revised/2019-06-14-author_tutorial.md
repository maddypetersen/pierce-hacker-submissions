## Lesson Abstract
This lesson is designed to both show how to make a lesson formatted for PierceHacker and also to serve as an example to aid in the creation of other lessons. The [raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jloan/pierce-hacker/gh-pages/_posts/2019-06-14-author_tutorial.md) for this lesson is also available so users can practice modifying it. A **[lesson template](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/blob/master/lessons/lesson-template.md)** is also available.

## Lesson Objectives/Outcomes
* Authors of lessons for PierceHacker should be able to use this lesson as a guideline to make their own. 
* Novices will be able to create a basic lesson.
* Authors will be able to reference this lesson to review their own work before submitting.

## Materials
* Growth mindset!
* To complete a lesson in markdown, you will need internet access and your favorite web browser
* ***A laptop or desktop computer is highly recommended over a phone or tablet***
* A markdown editing client is recommended
	- A great in-browser editor for beginners is [Editor.md](https://dillinger.io), this lesson was created with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) which is also free and easy to use.
	- Check [this page from Slant.co](https://www.slant.co/search?query=markdown%20editors) for other options
>	- If you choose to write your file in plain text or using an online workspace like [github](https://github.com/), check this [page from markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) that will help you format your file


## Overview
PierceHacker hosts lessons and other resources in order to help the Pierce College community develop new technical skills and better understand the ways in which technology shapes the work we do both in and out of the classroom. The obvious goal of these lessons is to provide a resource to students & professor. However, [open pedagogy](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) is at the heart of PierceHacker - we hope authors will gain as much from writing a lesson as they give. This lesson will provide some overview, tips, and resources for authors but also assumes a willingness to explore and experiment.

## Lesson Steps/Components

### 1. Know your purpose, define outcomes
Before you begin your lesson, make sure you have a clear idea of what it will be about. Lessons should have 2-3 learning outcomes; if you have more than this consider splitting your lesson into 2 or 3 smaller lessons. Recap:
* **Clearly define 2-3 learning outcomes**
* **Shorten long lessons or split them into smaller ones**

### 2. Understand and consider your audience
Your lesson may be for someone who has never used a certain program before or it may be for more advanced users. Make sure you have your audience clearly in mind when writing steps and make sure you keep a consistent voice. Over/under explaining some steps may be confusing for your readers. If you do want to include a note for advanced users, make it clear who that note is for. Recap:
* **Decide if your tutorial is for a novice, intermediate, or advanced user**
* **Keep this experience level in mind with each step - don't over/under explain**

### 3. Determine what the user will need
Remember that not everyone has a computer, or a specific operating system, etc. Think about what is absolutely required for your lesson and what you would recommend. Free software is always preferred so if your tutorial requires paid software, consider finding free alternatives. For example, Microsoft Word requires a subscription to use but markdown files can be written with a myriad of free software. [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) also provide free word processors. Provide links to required and recommended software. Recap:
* **Be explicit about what the user will need; i.e. internet access, hardware, operating system, software**
* **Use free software whenever possible**
* **Provide links to required/recommended software or website**

### 4. Start drafting
Start with the [lesson template](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/blob/master/lessons/lesson-template.md). By now, you should have enough information to fill out everything up to the Lesson Steps/Components portion. This is a great time to research other online lessons (or tutorials) to get an idea of how to make yours effective. Try not to hold yourself to a certain number of steps. Instead, write out as many steps as you think you need. If you feel like you have done this and your lesson is too long, it may be a good idea to break it up into 2 or more lessons. Recap:
* **Start filling out the [lesson template](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/blob/master/lessons/lesson-template.md)**
* **Try not to use too many steps or really long steps**

### 5. Review your work and make edits
First, read through your lesson. It may be helpful to have someone else look at it too. Pay attention to the voice of the lesson - is the voice consistent? Are there too many or too few assumptions about the user's knowledge? Are there any required materials that aren't listed (with links when possible)?

Also consider how easy it is to skim your lesson. Using headers and other formatting tools to make certain points stick out makes your lesson easier to use. It also helps for users who are coming back to your lesson for something specific. You may choose to restate key points at the end of each step as this document does or you may have a different approach. Try to choose a style that is accessible and makes sense for your lesson. Recap:
* **Make sure the voice is consistent and speaks to your audience**
* **Ensure all required materials are listed (with links when possible)**
* **Make sure your lesson is easy to skim - use formatting**
