## Overview


## Lesson Steps/Components
### 1. Know your purpose, define outcomes
Before you begin your lesson, make sure you have a clear idea of what it will be about. Lessons should have 2-3 learning outcomes; if you have more than this consider splitting your lesson into 2 or 3 smaller lessons. In summary:
* **Clearly define 2-3 learning outcomes**
* **Shorten longer lessons or split them into smaller ones**

### 2. Understand and consider your audience
Your lesson may be for someone who has never used a certain program before or it may be for more advanced users. Make sure you have your audience clearly in mind when writing steps and make sure you keep a consistent voice. Over/under explaining some steps may be confusing for your readers. If you do want to include a note for advanced users, make it clear who that note is for. In summary:

* **Decide if your tutorial is for a novice, intermediate, or advanced user**
* **Address this user with each step - don't over/under explain**

### 3. Determine what the user will need
Remember that not everyone has a computer, or your operating system, or your web browser, etc. Think about what is absolutely required for your lesson and what you would recommend

### 4. Start drafting


### 5. Review your work and make edits
