## Lesson Abstract
This lesson is designed to both show how to make a lesson formatted for PierceHacker and also to serve as an example to aid in the creation of other lessons. The **raw text** for this lesson is available so users can practice modifying it. A lesson template is also available **here**.

## Lesson Objectives/Outcomes
* Authors of lessons for PierceHacker should be able to use this lesson as a guideline to make their own. 
* Novices will be able to create a basic lesson.
* Authors will be able to reference this lesson to review their own work before submitting.

## Materials
* To complete a lesson in markdown, you will need internet access and your favorite web browser
* ***A laptop or desktop computer is highly recommended over a phone or tablet***
* A markdown editing client is recommended
	- A great in-browser editor for beginners is [Editor.md](https://dillinger.io)
	- This lesson was created with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) which is free, easy to use, and allows you to easily save files on your Google Drive (if you have gmail, you have this)
	- Check [this page from Slant.co](https://www.slant.co/search?query=markdown%20editors) for options specific to your operating system
>	- If you choose to write your file in plain text or using an online workspace like [github](https://github.com/), check this [page from markdown.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) that will help you format your file
* Growth mindset!

## Overview
PierceHacker hosts lessons and other resources in order to help the Pierce College community develop new technical skills and better understand the ways in which technology shapes the work we do both in and out of the classroom. The obvious goal of these lessons is to provide a resource to students & professor. However, [open pedagogy](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) is at the heart of PierceHacker - we hope authors will gain as much from writing a lesson as they give. This lesson will provide some overview, tips, and resources for authors but also assumes a willingness to explore and experiment.

## Lesson Steps/Components

### 1. Know your purpose, define outcomes
Before you begin your lesson, make sure you have a clear idea of what it will be about. Lessons should have 2-3 learning outcomes; if you have more than this consider splitting your lesson into 2 or 3 smaller lessons. Recap:
* **Clearly define 2-3 learning outcomes**
* **Shorten long lessons or split them into smaller ones**

### 2. Understand and consider your audience
Your lesson may be for someone who has never used a certain program before or it may be for more advanced users. Make sure you have your audience clearly in mind when writing steps and make sure you keep a consistent voice. Over/under explaining some steps may be confusing for your readers. If you do want to include a note for advanced users, make it clear who that note is for. Recap:

* **Decide if your tutorial is for a novice, intermediate, or advanced user**
* **Keep this experience level in mind with each step - don't over/under explain**

### 3. Determine what the user will need
Remember that not everyone has a computer, or a specific operating system, etc. Think about what is absolutely required for your lesson and what you would recommend. Free software is always preferred so if your tutorial requires paid software, consider finding free alternatives. For example, Microsoft Word requires a subscription to use but markdown files can be written with a myriad of free software. [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) also provide free word processors. Provide links to required and recommended software. Recap:
* **Be explicit about what the user will need; i.e. internet access, hardware, operating system, software...**
* **Recommend free software whenever possible**
* **Provide links to required/recommended software or website access**

### 4. Start drafting
Start with the [lesson template](https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/blob/master/lessons/lesson-template.md). By now, you should have enough information to fill out everything up to the Lesson Steps/Components portion.

### 5. Review your work and make edits
