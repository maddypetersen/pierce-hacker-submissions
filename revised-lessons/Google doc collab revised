### How to get Google Docs open

1. Log into [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com).

2. Open the apps menu at the top right and scroll down.

</p>

3. Open Google Docs.

</p>

4. Start a new document or open an existing one.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GDocCollab/c1.png" >
</p>

From here you can share your document.

#### How to share your document directly through an email

1. Press the "Share" button at the top right (Make sure your document has a good name).

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GDocCollab/d1.png" >
</p>

2. Enter the person's email in the text box.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GDocCollab/e1.png" >
</p>

3. Click the drop down to determine the access that the person has to your document.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GDocCollab/f1.png" >
</p>

4. Click send.

Now you shared the document and the recipient has access to it!

#### How to share your document with a link

1. Press the "Share" button at the top right (Make sure your document has a good name).

2. Click the "Get shareable link" button

3. Click the drop down to determine the access that the person has to your document.

4. Click the "Copy link" button.

Now you can paste the link wherever you want.

### How to work with a shared document as the recipient

The recipient of the document is limited to whichever level of access was given from the sender. 

For example, a recipient with "editing" access will be able to make changes directly to the document. A recipient who only has commenting access will only be able to make suggestions and comments to a document. If a recipient only has viewing access, then no additions/changes can be made.

If you have given someone the editing access you will then see them live on the doc with a colored cursor with their name. That means at the same time you can edit the document together.

**1. Change your current level of access with the drop down at the top right of the screen. You are limited to the highest level you were originally granted.**

All done! Now you have made a shared Google doc.
