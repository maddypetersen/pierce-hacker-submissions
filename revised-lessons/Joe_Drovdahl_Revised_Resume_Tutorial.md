Tips for Building a Professional Résumé
----------------------
1. Resume Layout:
 The layout is the first thing to affect the reader because it’s the first thing the brain processes—before even the text or texture is noticed. So, the resume’s layout is vital.
>a. Alignment:
- Résumé alignment is straightforward: that’s because resumes are almost always left alighted since most people in the Western world read text from left to right.
- Headings, experience bullet points, educational information, and additional skills should all be left aligned.
- The exceptions are name and contact details: these can be center aligned.
>b. Length:
- A professional résumé should be one-page in length. One-page résumés are focused, concise, and uncomplicated, which is what employers hope to see in résumés.
>c. Margin:
- One-inch margins are the most frequently used and recommended length. Vary margins within a range of ½–1 inch. Do not create margins to be wider than this as it may leave too much "white space" within the résumé giving the appearance of a lack of content.
>a. Font Styles: 
- Before choosing a particular font style, students need to choose between serif and sans-serif fonts.
- Serifs are the small lines attached to the ends of the letters.
- Serif fonts are most commonly used in Word processing or other nontraditional forms of typesetting.
- Note: Choosing between using sans or sans serif is a matter of personal preference—no font can be definitively said to be better than another
>b. Font Size:
- Résumé font size should be linked directly to font style but usually between 11 and 12 point font.
>c. Font Color:
- If students choose to use color, it should be a primary color, and it should be muted—no bright neon! Simple and subtle reigns supreme in the résumé world.
- The key with color in résumés is retaining the focus on the words rather than moving the reader’s focus to colors. Colors on résumés are meant to help convey information, not hinder it.
